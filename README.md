# DSPy Markdown Classification

Classify markdown documents into categories like transaction advices, investment reports, and loan agreements.

## Structure
- `classify.py`: Main script
- `business_logic.py` or `categories.json`: Business logic for categorization
- `llm/day1.py` to `llm/day5.py`: Learning scripts for each topic
